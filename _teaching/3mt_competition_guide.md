Even the world’s best public speakers prepare before important presentations. To assist you with your preparations, please find a few [suggestions](https://usfpgsc.github.io/teaching/3mt_competition_guide/) that will help you in writing your presentation, creating your slide and practising your presentation.

# 3MT Competition

Let’s get you started! You’re ready to do all the heavy lifting. We’re happy to simply lend a hand. We realize that there’s a lot going through your mind right now. 

Where to start? How to plan? 

Here are just a few things to help you out. 


## Drafting your presentation 

- Write for your audience
- Avoid jargon and academic language.
- Explain concepts and people important to your research – you may know all about Professor Smith’s theories, but your audience may not.
- Highlight the outcomes of your research, and the desired outcome.
- Imagine that you are explaining your research to a close friend or fellow student from another field.
- Convey your excitement and enthusiasm for your subject.


## Tell a story

- You may like to present your 3MT as a narrative, with a beginning, middle and end.
- It’s not easy to condense your research into three minutes, so you may find it easier to break your presentation down into smaller sections.
- Try writing an opener to catch the attention of the audience, then highlight your different points, 
and finally have a summary to restate the importance of your work


## Have a clear outcome in mind

- Know what you want your audience to take away from your presentation.
- Try to leave the audience with an understanding of what you’re doing, why it is important, and what you hope to achieve.


## What not to do

- Do not write your presentation like an academic paper.
- Try to use shorter words, shorter sentences, and shorter paragraphs.
- You can use humor, however, be careful not to devalue your presentation.


## Revise 

- Proof your 3MT presentation by reading it aloud, to yourself and to an audience of friends and family.
- Ask for feedback.
- Ask your audience if your presentation clearly highlights what your research is about and why it is important.

================

## Rules

Before you start work on your slide, you should take the following rules into account:

- One single static PowerPoint slide is permitted.
- No slide transitions, animations or ‘movement’ of any description are permitted.
- Your slide is to be presented from the beginning of your oration; and
- No additional electronic media (e.g., sound and video files) are permitted.
- If you need to reference a picture, image, or any kind of content in your slide, you can do it on the title page or at the bottom of the slide in a small box.

## Suggestions

You may like to consider some of the following suggestions.

- Less is more: text and complicated graphics can distract your audience – you don’t want them to read your slide instead of listening to your 3MT.
- Personal touches: personal touches can allow your audience to understand the impact of your research.
- Creativity drives interest: do not rely on your slide to convey your message – it should simply complement your oration.
- Work your message: think about how your slide might be able to assist with the format and delivery of your presentation – is there a metaphor that helps explain your research?
- An engaging visual presentation can make or break any oration, so make sure your slide is legible, clear, and concise.

## Practice, practice, practice

- Feeling nervous before you present is natural, and a little nervousness can even be beneficial to your overall speech. Nonetheless, it is important to practice so you can present with confidence and clarity. Practicing will also help you gauge the timing of your 3MT so that you keep within the time limit.

## Vocal range

- Speak clearly and use variety in your voice (fast/slow, loud/ soft).
- Do not rush – find your rhythm.
- Remember to pause at key points as it gives the audience time to think about what you are saying.

## Body language

- Stand straight and confidently.
- Hold your head up and make eye contact.
- Never turn your back to the audience.
- Practise how you will use your hands and move around the stage. It is okay to move around energetically if that is your personality, however it is also appropriate for a 3MT presentation to be delivered from a single spot on stage.
- Do not make the common mistakes of rolling back and forth on your heels, pacing for no reason or playing with your hair as these habits are distracting for the audience.

## Record yourself

- Record and listen to your presentation to hear where you pause, speak too quickly, or get it just right.
- Then work on your weaknesses and exploit your strengths.

## Look to the stars!

- Watch your role models such as academics, politicians, and journalists, and break down their strengths and weaknesses.
- Analyze how they engage with their audience.
- View presentations by previous 3MT finalists.

## Dress 

- There is no dress code, if you are unsure of how to dress you may like to dress for a job interview or an important meeting. It is important that you feel comfortable so you can focus on your presentation.
- If you are presenting on a stage that has a wooden floor, be aware of the noise your footwear might make.
- Do not wear a costume of any kind as this is against the rules (as is the use of props).

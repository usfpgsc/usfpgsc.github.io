# 3MT Competition

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming annual Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition in the Department of Physics. Following a successful run last year, we are excited to continue this tradition and hold the competition once again this year. The 3MT competition is a research communication competition that was initially developed by The [University of Queensland, Australia](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/). This exercise aims to enhance academic, presentation, and research communication skills while assisting students in effectively explaining their research using language that is suitable for an intelligent but non-specialized audience. Join us for another inspiring showcase of student research and communication excellence!

In this competition, graduate students will have **three minutes** to present a compelling oration on their dissertation/current research topic and its significance. 3MTâ„¢ is not an exercise in trivializing or â€˜dumbing-downâ€™ research but forces students to consolidate their ideas and crystalize their research discoveries. 


## Why participate? 


- **Skills development for research students**
  - Participating in 3MT develops academic, presentation and research communication skills, while developing research candidatesâ€™ ability to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialized audience.

- **Building intra-departmental research culture**
  - 3MT provides a valuable opportunity for graduate students to come together in person, get to know one another, and talk about their research. It also provides a supportive environment and presentation skills training.

- **Building external relations for the department/program**
  - 3MT winners may go on to represent the department at university, state, national, and international 3MT competitions which provides an excellent networking and professional development opportunity. Previous 3MT finalists at USF have benefited from invitations to a variety of other networking events following their participation in the competition

- **Preparation for Graduate Research Day event hosted by the PGSC in the fall**
  - The 3MT competition is a practice event for students to get used to speaking in front of large audiences and a judge panel about their research in preparation for the Gradute Research Day event hosted by PGSC and the physics department in the fall.

- **It looks good on your Resume/CV ðŸ˜Š**.

# 3MT Competition

We are very excited to announce the inaugural **Three Minute Thesis (3MT™) competition** in the Department of Physics. The 3MT™ competition is a research communication competition developed by The [University of Queensland, Australia](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/). The exercise develops academic, presentation, and research communication skills and supports the development of students' capacities to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience. 

In this competition, graduate students will have **three minutes** to present a compelling oration on their dissertation/current research topic and its significance. 3MT™ is not an exercise in trivializing or ‘dumbing-down’ research but forces students to consolidate their ideas and crystalize their research discoveries. 


## Why participate? 


- **Skills development for research students**
  - Participating in 3MT develops academic, presentation and research communication skills, while developing research candidates’ ability to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialized audience.

- **Building intra-departmental research culture**
  - 3MT provides a valuable opportunity for graduate students to come together in person, get to know one another, and talk about their research. It also provides a supportive environment and presentation skills training.

- **Building external relations for the department/program**
  - 3MT winners may go on to represent the department at university, state, national, and international 3MT competitions which provides an excellent networking and professional development opportunity. Previous 3MT finalists at USF have benefited from invitations to a variety of other networking events following their participation in the competition

- **Preparation for Graduate Research Day event hosted by the PGSC in the fall**
  - The 3MT competition is a practice event for students to get used to speaking in front of large audiences and a judge panel about their research in preparation for the Gradute Research Day event hosted by PGSC and the physics department in the fall.

- **It looks good on your Resume/CV 😊**.
